C BOOTCAMP 4 SESSION1

creating files 
    1) char filename[] = "filename.txt"
    2) FILE *file =fopen(filname, "w");
    

writing to files (w / w+)
    - w writes the line
    - a+ creates multiple lines
    - open file in read mode
    1) fprintf(filename, "the text");
    2) fclose(file);

reading from files (r / r+)
    - reading from a file before it has been created then error
    - takes a little bit more work 

    1) create a string that is big enough to store the contents of the file
    2) use the fgets() function to read the content of filename.txt
    3) fgets(buffer, buffer_size, file) takes 3 parameters
        - the first is where to store the file content, which will be in the buffer we created
        - the second is the maximum size of data to read ,which will be the size of buffer
        - the third is a file pointer used to require the file
    4) print("%s", buffer);
