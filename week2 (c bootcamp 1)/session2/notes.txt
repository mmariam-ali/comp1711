C BOOTCAMP 2

for loops
    - int i; #loop control variable
    - for (i=0; i<5; i++) { 

        return 0
    }

while loops
    - int a=0
    - while (a < 5) {
        printf("a");
        a++;
    }
    return 0;

arrays 
    - int a[10] (creating array with 10 values)
    - can accessed via a[i] or pointers
    - pointer is the address of a block of memory with a variable in it 
    - strings, an array of single characters (each take a byte of memory)
    - but the last element is hidden and contains a special terminator (\0)
    - an array of 10 chars actually has 9 or less
