Creating C file:
    - touch file
    - gcc file -o first
    - run /.file
    
    - always have #include <stdio.h>
    - always have int main () { return 0}
    - always end with ;

printing
    - print f("")
    - scanf variable_name (gets variables)
    - arguments passed in on same line after typing ./filename

Dealing with errors
    - fix the first and the rest should disappear

    - can be assigned or unassigned

        e.g int a (will be used later in loop, or can be assigned in loop)
    - temp variables
